This is Max's and my Stem Fair project for 2024-2025
dyslexia_detector is the main file where we put the website together with the eye tracking and the AI model. 
train_model.py is the file where we trained and created our model using our dataset from googlesheets - we have to run this on terminal before running our website to iniate the AI model before running the website itself.
test_run.py is the file we used to test the AI model and get the average accuracy.
This code only works on our computers though because we downloaded all the libraries and we had to use a local url because a public streamlit website doesn't work well with openCV which is a library we are using for the eye tracking. 
Thanks for reading this!
